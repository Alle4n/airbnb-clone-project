# StayEase: Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview

**StayEase** is a full-stack web application that replicates the core functionality of Airbnb. The platform enables users to browse property listings, view detailed information about properties, and complete secure bookings. This clone is intended to help us understand how to structure a complex web application, develop both frontend and backend components, and work collaboratively using best development practices.

### Project Goals

- **Build a fully functional booking platform** from scratch using modern web technologies.
- **Design and implement responsive, intuitive UI/UX** inspired by Airbnb's user interface.
- **Develop backend APIs and integrate a database** to handle user authentication, property listings, and bookings.
- **Practice agile development methodologies** by defining team roles and responsibilities.
- **Apply version control best practices** using Git and GitHub for collaborative development.
- **Deploy the application** to a live environment using CI/CD pipelines and DevOps tools.

### Tech Stack
