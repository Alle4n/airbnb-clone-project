# StayEase: Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview

**StayEase** is a full-stack web application that replicates the core functionality of Airbnb. The platform enables users to browse property listings, view detailed information about properties, and complete secure bookings.

- **Design and implement responsive, intuitive UI/UX** inspired by Airbnb's user interface.
- **Develop backend APIs and integrate a database** to handle user authentication, property listings, and bookings.
- **Practice agile development methodologies** by defining team roles and responsibilities.
- **Apply version control best practices** using Git and GitHub for collaborative development.
- **Deploy the application** to a live environment using CI/CD pipelines and DevOps tools.
